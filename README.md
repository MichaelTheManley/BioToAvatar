# BioToAvatar Mindjoy Project! 🦸‍♂️
The Mindjoy Project is a challenge to build a web application that takes in a user's biography, and in turn, using AI (specifically DALL-E 3), generates an avatar for the user based on their biography! This requires a little bit of prompt engineering as you need to adjust the input prompt as to receive an avatar that is a good depiction of the respective biography.

## Starting The Project 🏭
Upon opening the project, you will be met with both a frontend, and a backend folder.
### Starting The Frontend 👩‍💻
- Cd into the `frontend` folder
- Run the following in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, once you have installed the node modules, do the following:
```bash
npm start
```
Now you're frontend has started! It can be found on `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### Starting The Backend 🗄️
- Cd into the `backend` folder
- Run the following in the terminal:
```bash
bundle install
rails s
```
Now you will also have your backend running! Nice job 😎

### But One Last Thing...
Just before you get started, you MUST create a `.env` file in your `backend` folder. This file MUST contain the following:
```notepad
DALLE_API_KEY={your_api_key_for_openai}
```

This API key will be used for both the DALLE-3 API and the OpenAI API.

## How Does It Work? 💭
On your `localhost:3000` you will be able to type in a biography/description of who you are or what you love. Type this in (it must exceed 15 characters) and then click on `Submit`. This will then send the entered text to the OpenAI API, prompting it to return bullet points of what you have entered. These bullet points are then fed into the DALLE-3 API in order to then have your profile picture generated. 

Finally, once your profile picture has been generated by DALLE-3, it will then be displayed in the dedicated icon on the `localhost:3000` page.

## Technology Stack 🧱
