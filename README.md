# BioToAvatar Mindjoy Project! 🦸‍♂️
The Mindjoy Project is a challenge to build a web application that takes in a user's biography, and in turn, using AI (specifically DALL-E 3), generates an avatar for the user based on their biography! This requires a little bit of prompt engineering as you need to adjust the input prompt as to receive an avatar that is a good depiction of the respective biography.

### Technology Stack 🧱
